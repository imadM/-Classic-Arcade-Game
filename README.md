## Instructions

1. Use Chrome or Firefox. I'm not recommended Internet Explorer .
2. If you are using a downloaded version, unzip the file and run _index.html_. The game is ready to play as soon as the page loads.
3. You can start moving around by using arrow keys:
``move up: ↑
move down: ↓
move left: ←
move right: →``
4. In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.
